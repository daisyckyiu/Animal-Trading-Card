			<p>Hello! my full name Kangaroo derives from the Guugu Yimithirr word <em>gangurru</em>. My favorite place to hang out is in my mama's pouch called a <em>marsupium</em>.</p>
      <p>I like to hop, hences I have very strong hind legs with elastic tendon, which allows me to hop up to 43 mph at a short distance. My favorite food is grass. I can also be spotted at golf courses in my native land, Australia.</p>
